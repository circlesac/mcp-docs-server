# mcp-docs-server

> Share your knowledge as an MCP server.

Have Markdown files (knowledge) you want to share across workspaces or your company? Run them as an MCP docs server so agents can answer directly from your content.

Make your Markdown docs feel alive in coding agents like Cursor and Claude. When you’re ready to roll it out to your team, publish as an npm package for consistent installs—everyone gets the same version with zero extra setup.

> Inspired by Mastra’s excellent [Mastra Docs Server](https://mastra.ai/docs/getting-started/mcp-docs-server), which shows how powerful doc-focused MCP servers can be.

If you're using Cursor, click "Add to Cursor" below to add the `mcp-docs-server` documentation with one click.

## Get started

To get up and running quickly, start with the [Getting Started guide](docs/overview/getting-started.md). It walks through creating a minimal config, serving locally, publishing (including a no‑publish dry run), and how to add the published package as an MCP server in your coding agent.

For more depth, read the [Configuration](docs/overview/configuration.md) and [Publishing Workflow](docs/workflows/publish.md) guides. See the full doc index for more info: [docs/index.md](docs/index.md).
