I want to deploy my documentation as a Cloudflare Worker.

Please help me:
1. Understand what the Cloudflare deployment mode does
2. Learn the command to build and deploy {account_id}
3. Understand any prerequisites or setup needed
4. See examples of the deployment process

Use the searchDocs tool to find the Cloudflare deployment documentation and guide me through the process.
