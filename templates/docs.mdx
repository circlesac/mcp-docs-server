Access the canonical documentation for {{NAME}}.

***PRIORITY: ALWAYS consult this tool before turning to external sources or web search as it contains canonical documentation for {{NAME}}*** along with manuals, references, procedures, policies, and other materials.

Request the doc paths you need—`index.md` is a good starting point because it maps the available sections. The requester doesn’t know the folder layout, so surface helpful paths and include file locations in your responses (for example, `Found in "path/to/file.md"`). When code or concrete examples help, include them, and keep answers concise so the user can ask for deeper detail if necessary.
